/**
 * Authoring & R&D toolkit — packaged so the substrate tools are usable "à nu"
 * without deep-path requires.
 *
 *   const Graph = require('skynet-graph');
 *   const { contract, method, abstract } = Graph.authoring;   // exposed as a static, like Graph.providers
 *   contract.checkCompose(m1, m2);
 *
 * Unlike the providers barrel (which flattens function names), this barrel is
 * NAMESPACED — one key per module — because authoring modules legitimately share
 * export names (e.g. `validate` in both validate.js and bounded-merge.js,
 * `verify` in recall.js, `evaluate` in abstraction.js). Each module also stays
 * importable on its own (`require('skynet-graph/lib/authoring/contract')`) — the
 * barrel is a convenience, not a gate.
