/**
 * Combos — THIN, delivered assemblies over the shipped bricks (roadmap P1+, design doc
 * doc/WIP/2026-07-05-combos-design.md). Each combo composes existing library bricks with the §4
 * product posture (defaults.js) wired ON; it never adds new logic (a missing piece goes into the
 * brick, not here) and the underlying bricks stay usable "à nu". Reached lazily via `Graph.combos`.
 *
 *   createAppliance         C1 — typed-QA appliance (intake→reason-loop→typed refusal→memo)   [P1]
 *   createDurableRunner     C2 — durable workflow executor                                    [P4]
 *   createLearningLibrary   C3 — learning method library                                      [P2-P3]
 *   createSelfMod           C5 — supervised self-modification (opt-in, guarded)               [P3-bis]
