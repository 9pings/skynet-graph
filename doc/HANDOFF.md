# Handoff — Skynet-Graph V1 "MOE Graph"

**Date:** 2026-06-21 · **Branch:** `feat/moe-graph-v1-phase0` (off `master` @ `0e65ab4`)
**Status:** **76/76 tests green.** Phase 0 + Phase 1 complete; Inspector v1 built; the
decompose→synthesize **answer-loop** built; **memory-on-retraction + closed learning loop** built;
**array-append primitive** + **reactive budget cap** built; **typed-fact spine + canonicalization
barrier** (roadmap #1, the K1 keystone) built. The engine library is solid and heavily instrumented.

Read this, then `doc/MODELISATION.md` (the definitive model + prioritized roadmap), then resume.

## 0. Orientation & standing directives (do not violate)

Building the engine as a **MOE Graph** reasoning substrate. Model: nodes + segments (directed edges)
carry **typed facts**; **concepts** (declarative-JSON "experts") cast when their `require`/`assert`/
`ensure` hold — adding facts + child segments, cascade-triggering more concepts; a forward-chaining
**stabilization** loop runs to fixpoint; `ensure`/`unCast` **retracts** a concept + cascades when a
premise falls (JTMS defeasance). Providers (incl. a generic `LLM::complete`) do effectful work.

The flagship use: **answer enormous prompts without context-window blowup** — the graph is the working
memory; each LLM call sees only bounded local context. Loop: seed a root segment (prompt) → DECOMPOSE
into sub-path segments → stabilize → SYNTHESIZE bottom-up (bounded rollup) → answer.

**Standing user directives:**
- **BUILD, not thin-layer.** Implement the plan; don't re-litigate; don't downscope.
- **Never cap expressiveness** of expressions / mutation templates. (Validate *structure*, not grammar.)
- **Prefer leveraging what's already in the engine** over new machinery.
- **R&D working mode:** act as the concept/prompt-designer pro; deduce + build tools; use subagents for
  deep aspects; **step back between phases**; **verify-before-build** (reading the code has repeatedly
  caught wrong "free lunch" assumptions — keep doing it). The user's worry is a "trou sans fond"; the
  answer is *instrumented, incremental* R&D — each rung is tested + inspectable, so value is measurable.

## 2. How to run

```bash
npm test                  # 59 tests (node:test). Per-file count is deterministic; the AGGREGATE
                          #   count race-undercounts under --test-force-exit (all pass; verify per-file).
node _lab/run-basic.js    # non-LLM stabilization over the real `common` set
node _lab/run-prompt.js   # decompose→synthesize→answer vs a local LLM (LLM_BASE=...); writes a trace
node _lab/sg.js trace /tmp/run-prompt.trace.json    # inspect the reasoning trace
npm run build             # now works -> dist/Skynet.js (one benign "Critical dependency" warning)
```
Engine loads under Node via `_lab/_boot.js` (@babel/register). `_lab/concepts.js#buildConceptTree`
assembles a concept tree from `concepts/<set>/`.

## 3. KEY ENGINE FINDINGS / GOTCHAS (hard-won — read before building concepts)

1. **A concept MUST self-flag with its OWN `_name`** (e.g. set `Answer:true`), or `updateApplicableConcepts`
   keeps seeing it applicable and **re-fires it forever** (manifests as a non-stabilizing/timeout). The
   provider's mutation must include `{$_id:'_parent', <ConceptName>:true}`.
2. **To UPDATE an existing object via a template use `$$_id`** (literal id). A plain `_id` creates a NEW object.
3. **Arrays REPLACE on update** (`Entity.set`: `this._[key]=content`) — they do NOT concat. So a
   read-modify-write append from a provider RACES. Use the **`{__push:x}`** primitive (appends at
   serialized apply-time = race-free) for any fan-in counter/list. `[N×]` keys are also race-free (distinct).
4. **Global node refs in expressions need DOUBLE-`$`**: `$$budget:spent` — the ref regex consumes one `$`.
   (A single `$foo` is a key on the current scope.) `.length` resolves fine via `getRef`.
5. **`assert` vs `ensure`:** `ensure` installs watchers AND is **defeasant** (retracts the concept when the
   premise later falls). `assert` is a one-time gate at evaluation, **no watcher, no retraction**.
   → completion-gating / reactive re-test = `ensure`; **budget / "don't undo work already done" = `assert`**.
6. **The aggregation gap:** `getRef` walks SINGLE refs — no `forall`/`count`. Only `.length` on one array
   works. Race-free counting = `{__push}` into an array + `$$x:arr.length` gate. (The one core primitive
   still worth adding later: stratified set-aggregation `count`/`all`.)
7. **`cleaner` hook** (`Entity.js` ~224) fires on uncast with `(graph, concept, scope, argz, cb)`; its
   returned tpl is pushed. Mid-uncast `pushMutation` is **queue-safe** (the `_mutationThreadRunning` guard
   defers it — no re-entrancy). This is what makes memory-on-retraction zero-core.
8. **Reactive synthesis is NOT yet done** — the post-pass `synthesize` (in `_lab/loop.js`) is the current,
   correct, race-free synthesis. A reactive Rollup concept is now UNBLOCKED by `{__push}` (gate
   `$$x:answeredBy.length==$childCount`) but not built.
9. **Cast-state ≠ a literal `true`.** `_etty._mappedConcepts[Name]` records cast-state but its *value* is
   not the boolean `true` — to test "is concept C cast on obj," read the **self-flag fact** `obj._etty._.<C>`
   (what a provider / default-cast writes), or test *key presence* in `_mappedConcepts`. (Cost me a red test.)
10. **Why the canonicalization barrier works WITHOUT a core equality guard** (verified): `Entity.set`
   (Entity.js:330) destabilizes followers *unconditionally* (no `old===content` check). The memo / "don't
   re-fire" property is NOT from set-equality — it is from **cast-once + self-flag** (an already-cast concept
   is not re-fired) and **`ensure` re-test absorbing a same-value write** (unchanged discrete fact →
   `isApplicableTo` unchanged → no uncast → no cascade). Canonicalization (snap enums / round numerics) is
   what keeps the discrete fact *actually* stable so the gate doesn't spuriously flip. A prose-keyed gate
   flips every run → uncast → fragmentation. The optional N8 `old!==content` guard (literal hysteresis,
   skips even the re-sweep) stays out — `[C×1]`, and the barrier is correct without it.

## 4. The model (see doc/MODELISATION.md for the full thing)

Substrate = demand-driven incremental compute (Adapton/Salsa) + forward-chaining production + JTMS
defeasance over a typed-fact hypergraph. Workload = AND/OR graph search + bounded catamorphism (fold).
One reused mechanism: **everything-is-a-fact gated by `ensure`/`assert`**. Honest limits: K1 prose
memo-fragmentation (existential → typed-fact spine), coherence≠truth (K3 → verification), JTMS-not-ATMS
(fork for multi-world), cost-explosion (K2 → budget, now demonstrated).

---

## 5. Roadmap — pick up here (from MODELISATION §9, adjusted for what's now built)

Done: inspector · answer-loop · memory-on-retraction + learning loop · `{__push}` primitive · budget cap ·
**typed-fact spine + canonicalization barrier (#1)**.

Next, highest-leverage first:
1. **Reactive synthesis** — now unblocked by `{__push}`: a `Rollup` concept gated on
   `ensure:["$$<parent>:answeredBy.length == $childCount"]`, each child appends its id on Answer; provider
   reads `expandedInto` children's bounded answers. Replaces the post-pass for the live regime.
   (The barrier now in place keeps the rollup's child gates keyed on discrete facts — the #1→#2 dependency.)
2. **Verification concepts** (K3) — a refuter writes a distinct verdict key; k-of-n voting via `{__push}`
   + `.length`; gate downstream via `ensure`. Deterministic checkers >> LLM-refuters. (Verdicts are exactly
   the discrete facts the barrier mandates — author them with the `facts` contract; the validator guards them.)
3. **Freshness/TTL as facts** (N1) — timed-destabilize stale provider facts; enables the live/standing-paths
   regime (prospective/live/`ActiveProblem` terminals — MODELISATION N10).
4. **Declarative AI-authoring** — `addConcept` + the now-built validator (`_lab/validate.js` — extend it:
   structure, expr parse, ref-soundness, self-flag, prose-edge rejection already done) from a vetted provider
   palette; then **live self-modification** (meta-concept calls add/patchConcept mid-run) — LAST, gated behind
   trace+memory+budget; verify re-entrancy.
5. (core, optional) **stratified set-aggregation primitive** — generalizes `{__push}`+`.length`; unblocks
   richer voting/beam.
